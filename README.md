In this project, I developd a cloud-based application for
uploading, listing, and filtering images. it uses Node.js
Express, a popular javascript framework for networked application
development to develop this application. it implements a REST
API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web
Services Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase
with secure authentication signon features, and deploy to Amazon
Web Services Elastic Beanstalk.
